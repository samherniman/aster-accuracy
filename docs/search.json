The first model in our list of features will be the ability to count the number of bees on each frame of a colony and produce an accurate estimate of the number of individuals.\nWe are committed to being transparent around the accuracy and performance of our models throughout this process. This page will display these performance metrics for every iteration of these models. Additionally, we will provide an open verification dataset so that others can independently check our results and benchmark them against any future models.\nBelow, is an example image from the verification dataset and a prediction of detected individuals. Brighter locations signify higher predicted confidence.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nActual count: 888\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDetected count: 829"
